# getze-legacy

very old piece of software dated 2019. 
i dont really wanna comment anything what goes on in the code, original project is a mess and it was started in 2018 shortly after morphengine was closed.
this version of getze is dated around 2019 and ported to legacy in short time. didn't ment to be a p2c or something but extra version for free & fun. 
never was finished due to 2018 depot having low player base. 

i tried to get it working in 2021 (because cool getze-styled h4x) when 2018 depot got new wave of players, and understood that fixing this *piece of software* would not worth the timespend. 
it required deep recode. 

should've been releasing this years ago. Peace.

PS: i don't plan to update this *piece of software*, i will archive it after i make sure description is finished (readme).
