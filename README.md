# getze-legacy

very old piece of software dated 2019. 
i dont really wanna comment anything what goes on in the code, this project is a mess and it was started in 2018 shortly after morphengine was closed.

i tried to get it working in 2021 (cool getze-styled hack) and understood that fixing this cheat would not worth the timespend. 
it required deep recode. 

should've been releasing this years ago. Piece.
